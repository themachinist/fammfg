# Contribution Guidelines

## Developing on Snipe-MFG

Please submit pull requests to the [themachinist/snipe-mfg](http://github.com/themachinist/snipe-mfg) repository in the `dev` branch!

**As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch**. It makes it _much_ easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time, and makes it much easier for me to approve pull requests quickly.

If you don't have a feature in mind, but would like to contribute to the project, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/themachinist/snipe-mfg/issues?state=open) and see if there are any you can tackle.
