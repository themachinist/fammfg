This is a FOSS project for asset management in a manufacturing environment. In the case of the developer, that is in the tool crib of a machine shop. 

It is built on [Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com) and uses the [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) package.

__This is web-based software__. This means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows.
